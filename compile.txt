Tested on :
MSVC 1998,
MSVC 2005,
MSVC 2008.

To compile it you need D3SDK v1.4
Create folder "coop_m" inside D3SDK along with "anarchy" and "entropy" folders.
Decompress contain of one of the zips, into it.
Open the "coop.dsw" workspace, using MSVC 6.0 or 8.0 or 9.0.
Revise the linker settings in tab; it gives "co-op.dll" or "co-op.d3m", depending on needs.
Revise Custom Build step settings; it does copy the compiled file into some folder after linking.
Compile it :)

Beginning from version a7, D3 SDK v1.4 cannot be used without a modification, to compile this.
typedef vector vec;
This line needs to be added after 'vector' structure declaration in "vecmat_external.h".
It is because I would very dislike to type 'std::' each time, to avoid 'vector' identifier conflicts, getting "error C2872: 'vector' : ambiguous symbol".
