From ~2006-03 until 2006-07-28 the project was absolutely stuck, cause no any ways I was able to find for sending a warning or other info messages to players (clients).
In the beginning in the base were used few small important parts of "assault" mod source code.

Here are files, containing source code of modified Co-op Descent 3 game.
Many of subroutines here, must not be on the game mod level, but ... they are.
Whatever you do, make a backup copy of the original "Co-op.d3m" first, for example in ".\netgames\backup" folder.



// ----------------------------- DLL usage ways -----------------------------

To use it, you have to go by one of two ways :
1) Place "co-op.dll" and "coop.str" into "co-op.d3m" HOG2 pack.
2) Copy "co-op.dll" directly, naming it "co-op.d3m", and place "coop.str" to a reachable for D3 directory (not ".\netgames"), it may be the game root directory.
*game with such modification (made by the second way, but not by the first way) can't join co-op network games sometimes :(,
and original "co-op.d3m" will not work when "coop.str" replacement is accessible.
*to be able to debug it with MSVC 6.0 :
Project -> Settings... -> Link -> General -> Output file name:
change from "co-op.dll" to "co-op.d3m", then MSVC will get exceptions from our dll correctly.
*in MSVC 6.0, if just copy the compiled .dll to netgames and name it .d3m, then MSVC will not activate an already been set breakpoints; exceptions and newly set breakpoints do work.
*in any case - "coop.str" will be necessary mandatory.



// ----------------------------- other -----------------------------

*I've tried to leave "coop.cpp" without modifications as much as possible, so it is almost not remade "anarchy.cpp",
that would be possible to compare "coop.cpp" with "anarchy.cpp".
Well, at least the main blocks of that file are not modified.
It appears that the own config file isn't strongly needed if use D3Server Tool, cause it has autocommand;
maybe would be good to implement it for the otherwise case, but it is possible to use "autoexec.dmfc" file in netgames directory with settings :
"TeamDamage 0" and "sleep 20" for example.

Linux :
Some porting work was done by Cent; incomplete though, but should work somehow.
*that shall be very outdated for the current version. 

*from version a0 the chat logging is off by default.
*this info wouldn't be here, if EU laws wouldn't require to inform a user about logging.
Further look about logging in "usage.txt".
