You may want to play with AI of robots.
Co-op mod gives some partial access at those variables in a structure of an object.
Few commands for that do exist.
Short versions of those commands are mentioned inside of parentheses



For example, you may wish to create a bot, which normally is an enemy, but so that it would be friendly.

Set your shield to a high value, otherwise that robo may destroy you, while you will do next operations :
$playershield 0 10000
($ps)

Spawn the robot object ahead of you :
$spawninfront <objid>
($sif)
(object ids you may find in "objects.h")
Lets say :  390, 486, 487 for yellow lasers, vauss, md mercenaries, or 640 for the flying ally machine gun, or 284 for superthief.
When the object will be spawned, you must remember its index, and use it later to make any updates to it.

Rise object shields, so that it wouldn't be easily destroyable :
$objectshield <objix> 10000
($os)

If it is Superthief, you probably want to give him some strong weapon.
Activate that weapon at yourself (spawn it for yourself, if you don't have).
Turn the back side to the thief and let it to take it.
Go away.

Make it ally :
$ObjectAIFlagRebel <objix> 1
($oaifr)

Now maybe want to try other $OAIxx commands.
Particularly $ObjectAIType ($oait), to change the main behaviour - movement.

Normalize your shield, if necessary :
$PlayerShieldNormalize 0
($psn)



*commands are inconvenient, I know.
The objid should be set in some global variable and then reused, rather than entered each time again and again.
